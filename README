Exercise from [Chapter 8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html#summary) of the Rust book.

Given a list of integers, return its median and mode.

Usage: User runs the program through the CLI and enters the length of the list. The program randomly generates the list elements. All numbers are between 0 and 10. It then prints the median and the mode.

There are 3 versions of this program.

Each is written in the same way:
* The code in the main functions deal only with the CLI.
* The logic of the application is placed in modules.
* Each unit of functionality, except for the interface, has its own unit test.

I've tried to make the code as modular as possible. This way the logic can be extracted easily.

There's no error handling.

Future improvements:
    - Convert modules to WASM
